##  Obesity Classification System

###  Overview

The **Obesity Classification System** is a machine learning–based web application that predicts a person’s obesity level based on their lifestyle and physical attributes.
It uses **Python (scikit-learn)** for model training and **Streamlit** for the frontend interface, allowing users to easily check their obesity risk through an interactive web form.

---

###  Objectives

* Help users understand their obesity risk level.
* Encourage healthy lifestyle changes with personalized feedback.
* Demonstrate an end-to-end data science product — from preprocessing and model training to a deployable software solution.

---

###  Machine Learning Models Used

We trained and compared multiple classification algorithms:

* **Logistic Regression**
* **Random Forest Classifier**
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

After evaluation, the best-performing model was integrated into the Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.

###  Tech Stack

**Backend / Model**

* Python 3
* scikit-learn
* pandas, numpy

**Frontend / UI**

* Streamlit

**Version Control**

* Git & GitHub

---

###  System Architecture

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Cleaned and encoded the Obesity dataset.
   * Scaled numerical features for better model performance.
   * Saved the final preprocessed dataset and trained model using `joblib`.

2. **Model Training & Evaluation**

   * Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and KNN models.
   * Evaluated using accuracy and classification reports.
   * Selected the best model for deployment.

3. **Frontend Integration**

   * Built a Streamlit-based web interface.
   * Users can input personal and lifestyle data to get predictions.
   * The app displays the predicted obesity class and relevant feedback areas (e.g., *Low hydration*).

###  Example Output

After submitting your details, the app shows:

* **Predicted Category:** e.g., *Overweight_Level_I*
* **BMI:** e.g., *24.22*
* **Activity/Day:** e.g., *1.0h*
* **Hydration:** e.g., *2.0L*
* **Attention Areas:** e.g., *Low hydration*

###  Future Improvements

* Deploy on cloud (e.g., Streamlit Cloud or Render).
